# changed the variable names to be clearer
# this was tricky to figure out
# I had to look up how input() works
# this works but I'm not sure if there's a better way
# I had to look up how input() works
# might need to fix this later
# based on the textbook example
# fixed a bug where it was giving wrong answers
# I think this is correct
